This is a TicTacToe iPhone OS App. I hope you like it :)

v0.9.0: Cleaned up TicTacToeViewController.m
	Added the xOrY property to check if a TouchCells object is filled by an XView (0) or OView (1). 

v0.9.1:	-Addition of Win and Tie Checking!
		-Uses the xOrY property and changed values to -1 and 1 because null cells triggered the 0 value and caused X to win every turn (rather repetitive).
		-[NOTE: Winning doesn't draw a win message (yet), but prints NSLog() to console and disables further user input.]


v0.9.2: -Addition of a dialogue box presented after game ends. Contains a UILabel sepcifying who won (or Draw) and a UIButton that resets the game calling selector "resetGame"
	-Cleaned up turn changing with some enums in TTTVC and TouchCells
